# Cryptocurrencies
  ## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to utilize unsupervised machine learning to examine cryptocurency data. This method was chosen as there was no known output and we wanted to figure out what the data could tell us. In this analysis, we've been asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new hypothetical investment.
  ## Results
  Because the data was not ideal to begin with, it had to be processed to fit the machine learning models first. 
  Then, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized in order to reduce the dimensions of the data, and the K-means algorithm was used to create the following elbow curve plot.

## Summary
Unsupervised machine learning proved to be a challenging topic to cover, however I look forward to practicing and building upon my skills and understanding.
